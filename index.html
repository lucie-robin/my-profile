                  I love animals. Here is a picture of my dog, he is 2 years old and his name is Eden. I adopted him in Guadeloupe.

                <p> 
                I love traveling. I already went on 4 different continents, and I have lived a few months in Singapore. Moreover, I speak 5 different languages and I would like to learn in the next few years an other one.
